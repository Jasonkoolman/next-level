In general, Server and Client Components allow developers to build applications that combine the rich interactivity of client-side applications with the improved performance of traditional server rendering.

Server Components are React components that are rendered on the server and sent to the client as static HTML. They can leverage server infrastructure and keep large dependencies and sensitive information on the server, leading to improved performance. Server Components are the default in Next.js, and all components inside the app directory are considered Server Components by default.

Client Components are components that are rendered on the client and hydrated with data from the server. They are useful for adding interactivity and event listeners to your application, as well as using state, lifecycle effects, and browser-only APIs. Client Components are marked with the "use client" directive, which declares a boundary between the Server and Client Component module graph. Once "use client" is defined in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle.

To decide whether to use Server or Client Components, the following table summarizes their different use cases:

| What do you need to do?                                                      | Server Component | Client Component |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Fetch data                                                                   | ✅               | ⚠️               |
| Access backend resources (directly)                                          | ✅               | ❌               |
| Keep sensitive information on the server (access tokens, API keys, etc)      | ✅               | ❌               |
| Keep large dependencies on the server / Reduce client-side JavaScript        | ✅               | ❌               |
| Add interactivity and event listeners (onClick(), onChange(), etc)           | ❌               | ✅               |
| Use State and Lifecycle Effects (useState(), useReducer(), useEffect(), etc) | ❌               | ✅               |
| Use browser-only APIs                                                        | ❌               | ✅               |
| Use custom hooks that depend on state, effects, or browser-only APIs         | ❌               | ✅               |
| Use React Class components                                                   | ❌               | ✅               |

In general, it's recommended to use Server Components until you have a need to use a Client Component. To improve performance, it's also recommended to move Client Components to the leaves of your component tree where possible.
